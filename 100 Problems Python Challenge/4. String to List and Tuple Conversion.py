# Question:
# Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and generate a list and a tuple which contains every number.
# Suppose the following input is supplied to the program:
# 34,67,55,33,12,98
# Then, the output should be:
# ['34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98']
# ('34', '67', '55', '33', '12', '98')


num_list = input('Write a list of numbers: ').split(',')
print(num_list)
print(tuple(num_list))
